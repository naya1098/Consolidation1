# Consolidation1
Welcome to the Ethics Game Manual! 

This is going to be an interactive Python script that tests your ethical choices with a series of “simple” but thought provoking questions.  At the very end you will receive your score which will determine how human you really are. Take this test if you dare….

First download the script: Download the Python file Consolidation1.py to your computer or laptop.
Then open your terminal or command prompt (I use anaconda): Navigate to the directory where you downloaded Consolidation1.py
Run the script: Type Consolidation1.py and press enter. Make sure that you are using Python! 

How to Play! 
The game will start automatically once you run the script.

Answer the questions by typing y (yes) or n (no) when prompted, then press enter.
Wait for the transitions between questions and enjoy the credits at the end before viewing your score.

Some in game limitations:
The game currently supports only yes (y) or no (n) binary answers.
All questions are arranged in a similar format and may not cover a wide range of ethical scenarios because of limited time. 
The script cannot run without user input, it is waiting for user input in order to move on.
